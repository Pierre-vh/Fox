Work on this part of the project has just started, so expect the VM to be in
a molten, unfinished state for quite some time. I'll be experimenting a lot!

Basic VM data types and their mappings to Fox types:
    Fox       VM
    int       int
    double    double
    bool      int
    char      TBA
    string    TBA
    []        TBA
   

Roadmap: Follows a "basic" plan - implement - test development cycle

Current issues/todos:
  -> Find something other than "AB_INSTR" "ABC_INSTR", etc. I need something more scalable and clean.
      The ideal scenario would be to pass arguments to the macro like this: "INSTR(Foo, (INT8, INT8))"

---- Initial Preparation and Scaffolding ----

  -> Opcode (Done)
  -> InstructionBuilder (Done)
  -> VM Scaffolding: Registers data structure, basic methods such as run()

---- Implementation of Int/Double/Bool and related functionalities ----

  -> Implement basic binary operations on integers and doubles: + - * / %
    -> Declare opcodes (Done)
    -> Implement opcodes
    -> Do unit tests
       
  -> Implement comparisons : >= <= > < == !=
    -> Declare opcodes
        // For integers, we only implement == >= and >, the rest can be
        // implemented by adding "nots" or swapping operands as needed, but for
        // doubles every op is implemented because of NaNs shenanigans
                  ==   !=   <=   <   >=   >
        Integers: ieq      ileq ilt
        Doubles   deq      dleq dlt dgeq dgt
    -> Implement
    -> Test

  -> Implement logic operators : || and &&
    -> Declare opcodes
        and 
        or
    -> Implement
    -> Test

---- Implementation of Char ----
  
  TBA. Will probably be implemented as an int in the VM unless I find
  a good reason to not do it.

---- Implementation of String & Arrays and GC ----
  
  TBA. Will be implemented as Objects, so the GC will be implemented at the same time.
  Objects will be allocated in a special allocator which just uses new/delete, but it'll
  also keep a list of allocated objects.
  
  -> Base "Object" class
  -> Array and String objects (derived classes)
  -> "ReferenceMap" to track registers that are/aren't references on the stack
  -> Basic GC algorithm: mark and sweep + colored objects.
