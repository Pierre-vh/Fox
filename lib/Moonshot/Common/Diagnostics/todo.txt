TODO:
> Add formatting functions to the Diagnostic to replace placeholders.
	> At first, just replace %0, %1, %2, etc.. with any type supported by stringstream. This is just what I need, nothing more.
> Add options to the DiagnosticEngine (allWarningsAreError,IgnoreWarnings,ignoreAll) + helpers (has(Warning/Error/Fatal error)occured ?)
> Sourceloc system
	> SourceManager (a class that keeps track of source file contents and assigns an ID to them)
		> addFromFile() (returns the ID, -1 if failed to read source file)
		> addFromString() (returns the ID, -1 if failed to add source file)
		> getSourceForID() (returns a reference to the source, not the source directly, to avoid huge copies)
	> SourceLoc object
		> Contains an ID + Col + Line in file
			> Challenge : find a way to keep this small, under 64 bits would be preferable. Maybe use a bitfield ?
		> Add it to tokens & ast & diag

> Write all the remaining tests needed.
> Move all my current diagnostics message to the new system and delete the context's system primitive diag system.

> Move on to AST 2.0

DONE:
> Add the StreamDiagConsumer to print diagnostics to the cout, or a file, or a sstream.
