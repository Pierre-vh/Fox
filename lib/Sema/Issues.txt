To Fix:
  Error Spam by the ExprFinalizer in situation such as this:
    [[],[],[]] as int[]
      Expr is already known to be bad, no need to spam. 
        Either block diags hen visiting an ErrorType expr's children
        or
        Create a function that sets a Type to error type in this fashion:
        Array(SemaType(SemaType(SemaType(empty)))) to Array(SemaType(SemaType(SemaType(ErrorType))))
          -> ASTWalker should handle that. Create type walking functions that just return booleans.

  Imprecise errors in this situation:
    [[],[],[]] as int[]
      First, the error is reported with SemaTypes(), which is wrong in itself
      Second, even without sematypes, the error is something like
        ArrayType(ArrayType()). Do something more user friendly. Find a way
        to emit a proper type name. e.g.
          <unknown>[][]
          [[unknown]]    // nice looking
