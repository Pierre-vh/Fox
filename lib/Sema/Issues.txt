List of "traps" that semantic analysis might fall into, and that will need to be tested.

	// Will probably fail to determine arraytype
	let x : int[][] = [[],[],[], [1]];
	let x : int[][] = [[],[],[]];

	This exposes a clusterfuck in my logic. I'll have to rest a bit and then rethink the way SemaTypes
	are handled in unifySubtype and tryJoinSemaTypes.
