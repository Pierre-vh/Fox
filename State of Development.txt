I'm currently trying to refocus on important things, which means that I'm going to try and follow a stricter development policy. 
The "development policy" I chose is "Make it Work - Make it Right - Make it Fast".

Currently, I'm in the "Make it work" phase, which means that I'll focus on progressing in development, without looking back too much
at existing code (well, except for the lexer which WILL need a rework as soon as possible).

Once my interpreter is complete, compiles without errors and can run basic Fox code, I'll switch to the make it right phase, which will
be oriented towards refactoring/testing/DRYing code. In short, I'm going to try and make Moonshot's source code concise, pleasant to read
and more documented. In this phase I'll also try to catch as much bugs as possible by constantly stress-testing the interpreter.

And, the last phase is going to be "Make it fast", with frequent profilings, reworking slow code, etc.
