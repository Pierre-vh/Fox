	> ASTContext : Types (Done)
	> New type system & deletion of /Common/Types (Done!)
	> Replace strings in the AST by IdentifierInfo* pointers (Done)	
	> ParsingResult rework (Done)
	> AST Improvements (Done)
	> Add ASTContext,parser & ast support for arrays types & Array literals. (Done)
	> Parser recovery improvements part 1(Done)
	> Parser recovery improvements part 2 (Done)
	> Parser recovery improvements part 3 : Reworked it entirely again! (Done)
	> Parsing Result Rework & Parser Improvements Part 4 : Final part (Done)
	> Create a "DeclarationRecorder", which is a wrapper around a std::multimap<IdentifierInfo*,ASTNamedDecl*> (Done)
	> Parser support for DeclRecorder with a RAIIContext object. (Done)
	> UniquePtrVector & DereferenceIterators + Minimizing interaction with unique pointers for AST Visitors(Done)
	> Major AST "Cleanup" in preparation for Visitor pattern rework (Done)
	> Write more Unit tests (Done)
	> Visitor system rework (Done)
	> Delete old ASTVisitor & Dumper  (Done)
	> Rewrite dumper under the new system	(Done)

	> Do some polish on ASTDumper. (Done? Will still come back to that from time to time!)
	> Make "MapDataIterator" work (next)
	> Write tests for the new visitor system (Do more of them)

> Sourceloc system
	> SourceManager (a simple class that keeps track of source file contents and assigns an ID to them.)
		> addFromFile() 
		> addFromString() 
			>	both of theses 2 functions will return a lightweight "Response", with a status indicating if the operation was a success and the index
				of the source in the sourcemanager's internal vector
		> getSourceForID() (do not return a copy of the source, but a reference/pointer)
	> SourceLoc object
		> Current idea : store the ID + a uint32_t for the character index.
	> SourceRange 
		a Sourceloc + an offset (uint16)
	> Update lexer to add a sourcerange/loc to every single token
	> Update ast so all nodes have a sourceloc/range too !
	> Update Diagnostics & DiagnosticsEngine to support a sourceloc/sourcerange arg.
> Write all the remaining tests needed.

> Move all of my current diagnostics message to the new system.
> Delete the Context's system primitive diag system.

> Semantic Analysis.
	> Sema class
	> ExprSema
		> ExprEnvironement
	> DeclSema
		> Scopes
	> StmtSema
	> Currently, no "TypeSema" because most types are trivial enough (only primitive types & arrays). They don't need over-complicated analysis.
