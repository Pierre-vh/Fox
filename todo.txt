Disclaimer:
This file contains a short term, rapidly changing road map. Essentially, if I need to get something done tomorrow, I'll write it here.
Theses can be considered personal notes, and you shouldn't consider what's in this file as a true roadmap.

-> Finish Parser test impl on googletest
	-> (DONE) Dumper should be able to output stuff to a sstream/fstream				
	-> Implement every parser test in GTest
	-> Output ast by default in /tests/logs. /test/logs should be in gitignore
-> Delete /lib/Moonshot/tests 

-> Context & DiagEngine revamp, Clang-like system
	-> DiagEngine, DiagConsumers, Diagnostic pieces
	-> use a .def to register new diagnostics and a DiagnosticKind enum

-> Add a FlagsManager class
	-> use a .def file to register all possible flags
	-> add flags by text or enum
	-> access functions : isSet(flag) unSet(flag)

-> AST Revamp
	-> New visitor system
	-> New ASTContext & Type nodes
		-> Finish refactor in /Common/types

-> Do a "polish pass" after all this code's done, meaning : Write unit tests, rewrite dirty code, find other stuff to fix

-> Move on to Semantic analysis : Sema & Name resolution.

-> Consider adding multiple source files support at this point, while doing so, plan the codegen phase and set on a final vm : Register or Stack based? Opcodes? etc.
