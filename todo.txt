> AST 2.0
	> ASTUnit : Represents a source file, contains declarations. (Done)
	> IdentifierTable & IdentifierInfo (Done)
	> ASTContext (Done)
	> Move stuf to /Fox/Basic (Done)
	> ASTContext : Types (Done)
	> New type system & deletion of /Common/Types (Done!)
	> Replace strings in the AST by IdentifierInfo* pointers (Done)	
	> ParsingResult rework (Done)
	> AST Improvements (Done)
	> Add ASTContext,parser & ast support for arrays types & Array literals. (Done)
	> Parser recovery improvements part 1(Done)
	> Parser recovery improvements part 2 (Done)
	> Parser recovery improvements part 3 : Reworked it entirely again! (Done)
	> Parsing Result Rework & Parser Improvements Part 4 : Final part (Done)
	> Create a "DeclarationRecorder", which is a wrapper around a std::multimap<IdentifierInfo*,ASTNamedDecl*> (Done)
	> Parser support for DeclRecorder with a RAIIContext object. (Done)

	> Create a "UniquePtrVector" class that acts a wrapper around a vector of std::unique_ptr and provides raw pointers to each
	unique_ptr content. This will make it easier to work with vectors of unique_ptr while providing safe iterators that hides the implementation.
	
	> DeclRef nodes : getDecl(), hasBeenLinkedToDeclaration(), etc.

	> At this point if nothing caught fire, write unit tests to catch bugs and make things catch fire.
		> Test DeclRecorder chaining : Does it work correctly?
		> Type tests ? (Like, try to identify types by comparing ASTContext pointers, etc)	(Done)
		> Does lookup work as intended 
		> Uniqueness of identifiers (Done)
		> Try to break stuff with edge cases. 

	> Visitor System rework, inspired by CLang/Swift.
		> ASTVisitor (class that visits a tree however it likes to)
		> Maybe an ASTWalker. It would be quite handy for Dumper and to create a Constant Folding visitor. 
			See Swift's impl
				https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/include/swift/AST/ASTWalker.h
				https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/lib/AST/ASTWalker.cpp
				It's quite complicated, maybe a simplified version would work.
	> Delete old ASTVisitor & Dumper 
	> Rewrite dumper under the new system
	> Write tests for the new visitor system

> Sourceloc system
	> SourceManager (a simple class that keeps track of source file contents and assigns an ID to them.)
		> addFromFile() 
		> addFromString() 
			>	both of theses 2 functions will return a lightweight "Response", with a status indicating if the operation was a success and the index
				of the source in the sourcemanager's internal vector
		> getSourceForID() (do not return a copy of the source, but a reference/pointer)
	> SourceLoc object
		> Current idea : store the ID + a uint32_t for the character index.
	> SourceRange 
		a Sourceloc + an offset (uint16)
	> Update lexer to add a sourcerange/loc to every single token
	> Update ast so all nodes have a sourceloc/range too !
	> Update Diagnostics & DiagnosticsEngine to support a sourceloc/sourcerange arg.
> Write all the remaining tests needed.

> Move all of my current diagnostics message to the new system.
> Delete the context's system primitive diag system.

> Semantic Analysis time ! It's going to be fun (or not :) ) !
