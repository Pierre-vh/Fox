	> AST Improvements (Done)
	> Add ASTContext,parser & ast support for arrays types & Array literals. (Done)

	> DeclContext : ASTDecl abstract node wrapper around std::map<IdentifierInfo*,ASTDecl*>
		> Add it on nodes that need it (funcdecl,if/else/,loops,unit)
		> Lookup system with "restrictedLookup" (only this declcontext) and "fullLookup" call upper declcontexts to lookup and add lookupresults
		> For the lookup system, I'll need "LookupResult" class that wraps around an array of std::pair<IdentifierInfo*,IASTDecl*> for all matching decls.
	> DeclRef nodes : getDecl(), hasBeenLinkedToDeclaration(), etc.

	> At this point if nothing caught fire, write unit tests to catch bugs and make things catch fire.
		> Test DeclContext chaining : Does it work correctly?
		> Type tests ? (Like, try to identify types by comparing ASTContext pointers, etc)
		> Does lookup work as intended 
		> Uniqueness of identifiers (Done)
		> Try to break stuff with edge cases.

	> Visitor System rework, inspired by CLang/Swift.
		> ASTVisitor (class that visits a tree however it likes to)
		> Maybe an ASTWalker. It would be quite handy for Dumper and to create a Constant Folding visitor. 
			See Swift's impl
				https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/include/swift/AST/ASTWalker.h
				https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/lib/AST/ASTWalker.cpp
				It's quite complicated, maybe a simplified version would work.
	> Delete old ASTVisitor & Dumper 
	> Rewrite dumper under the new system
	> Write tests for the new visitor system

> Sourceloc system
	> SourceManager (a simple class that keeps track of source file contents and assigns an ID to them.)
		> addFromFile() 
		> addFromString() 
			>	both of theses 2 functions will return a lightweight "Response", with a status indicating if the operation was a success and the index
				of the source in the sourcemanager's internal vector
		> getSourceForID() (do not return a copy of the source, but a reference/pointer)
	> SourceLoc object
		> Current idea : store the ID + a uint32_t for the character index.
	> SourceRange 
		a Sourceloc + an offset (uint16)
	> Update lexer to add a sourcerange/loc to every single token
	> Update ast so all nodes have a sourceloc/range too !
	> Update Diagnostics & DiagnosticsEngine to support a sourceloc/sourcerange arg.
> Write all the remaining tests needed.

> Move all of my current diagnostics message to the new system.
> Delete the context's system primitive diag system.

> Semantic Analysis time ! It's going to be fun (or not :) ) !
