Theses are mostly personal notes.

## File headers
file_header.txt is the text that must be copy-pasted at the beginning of every file of the Moonshot project that is made by you/me. The only files where
it's not needed are the "Utils.h/.cpp", because theses files contain bits of code that are found on the internet. (Like std::unique_ptr dynamic cast,etc.)


## Grammar
grammar_x.x.txt contains the current version of the Fox programming language's grammar in EBNF Format. The version number is incremented by .1 
after minor changes are made.

### Grammar Changelog : 
1.0 -> First version that had a lot of error (it was my first try at making a full ebnf grammar).
1.1 -> Reworked expressions, added one-stmt blocks and support for unary operators ! and - and type conversion.

## Guidelines

General coding tips and guidelines for the project. They should be followed as much as possible to ensure consistent coding style.

## To Do Stdlib

This is a list of ideas of functions that need to be added to the standard library once the interpreter is finished. Feel free to complete it ! I Need ideas :)
