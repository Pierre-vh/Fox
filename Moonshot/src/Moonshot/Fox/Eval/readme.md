This folder contains classes that evaluate the AST.

They are mostly deprecated and are only used for testing purposes now (to ensure that the AST is properly formed in expr tests) and to do basic variable tests, which are
just temporary and meaningless.

Most of the code present here will be unused in the future when the backend is complete, but some parts of the code in /expr/ will be salvaged to make the 
constant folding optimization.
