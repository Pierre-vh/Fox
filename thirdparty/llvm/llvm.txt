Notice: This folder contains some files that I imported/extracted from the LLVM project.
Theses files have sometimes been modified to remove dependencies, or remove some functionality that
I did not need. They're all header only.

Non exhaustive changes list:
	Support/DataTypes.h
		This file is the one found in llvm-c/DataTypes.h instead of the wrapper
		located in llvm/Support/DataTypes.h

  Support/Compiler.h
    Removed llvm-config include

  Support/MemAlloc.h
    Removed include "ErrorHandling.h"
    Replaced calls to report_bad_alloc with calls to a llvm_bad_alloc macro
      defined at the top of the file.
      The code for this macro is a shortened version of the one found in
      /lib/Support/ErrorHandling.cpp

  Support/MathExtras.h
    Commented out lines 364-400 due to MSVC C4146  

  Support/Host.h
    Removed everything except the endianness related functionalities

	ADT/PointerIntPair.h:
		Removed DenseMapInfo features

  ADT/PointerUnion.h
    Removed include: "llvm/ADT/DenseMapInfo.h"
    Removed lines 463-488 "Teach DenseMap how to use PointerUnions as keys."

  ADT/SmallVector.h
    Removed ErrorHandling. hinclude
    Inlined grow_pod to remove need for SmallVector.cpp 
    Removed LLVM_NODISCARDs (Caused compiler errors on MSVC)

  ADT/ArrayRef.h
    Removed Hashing functions
    Replaced include: "llvm/ADT/STLExtras.h" with "llvm/ADT/iterator.h"
    Removed LLVM_NODISCARDs (Caused compiler errors on MSVC)

  ADT/TrailingObjects.h
    (Line 202) Adding static_cast<size_t> to alignTo's result to silence C4244 on MSVC
    (Line 284) Removed the "Obj" parameter name to silence C4244 on MSVC

  ADT/Hashing.h
    Removing fixed_seed_override to remove dependency on .cpp file
