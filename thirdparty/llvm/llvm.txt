Notice: This folder contains some files that I imported/extracted from the LLVM project.
Theses files have sometimes been modified to remove dependencies, or remove some functionality that
I did not need. They're all header only.

Non exhaustive changes list:
	Support/type_traits.h
		Removed #include "Compiler.h"
		Removed LLVM_IS_FINAL macro
		Removed __has_feature macros
		Modified isPodLike to use is_trivially_copyable in all cases

	Support/DataTypes.h
		This file is the one found in llvm-c/DataTypes.h instead of the wrapper
		located in llvm/Support/DataTypes.h

  Support/Compiler.h
    Removed llvm-config include

  Support/MathExtras.h
    Removed SwapByteOrder include
    Removed functionalities that used SwapByteOrder:
      ByteSwap_16, ByteSwap_32, ByteSwap_64
    Removed (commented) lines 364 to 399
  
  Support/MemAlloc.h
    Removed include "ErrorHandling.h"
    Replaced calls to report_bad_alloc with a custom macro whose code
      comes from the implementation of llvm::report_bad_alloc_error
      in lib/Support/ErrorHandling.cpp

	ADT/PointerIntPair.h:
		Removed DenseMapInfo features

  ADT/PointerUnion.h
    Removed include: "llvm/ADT/DenseMapInfo.h"
    Removed lines 463-488 "Teach DenseMap how to use PointerUnions as keys."

  ADT/SmallVector.h
    Removed ErrorHandling. hinclude
    Inlined grow_pod to remove need for SmallVector.cpp 
    Removed several LLVM_NODISCARD tags that caused some compiler errors
