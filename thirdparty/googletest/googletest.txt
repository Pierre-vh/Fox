This folder contains the googletest library. The project has been cleaned-up to minimize
the amount of files checked in the Fox GitHub repository.

1 - Only the "googletest" project folder is used (not googlemock).
2 - Removed every folder and file inside the googletest project with the exception of
    a - 'include' folder
    b - 'src' folder (note: gtest-main.cc has been removed from that folder).
    c - LICENSE file
