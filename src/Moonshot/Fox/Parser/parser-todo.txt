The parser error messages are pretty primitive for now, when doing the diagnostics upgrade later, I need
to add a position (idx) arg to errorExpected, so it prints a correct "expected x after (token at position idx)"
This arg would default to the current position.

Also, adding a custom "matchResult" class to encapsulate a position would be great.
It would need to hold a position & the result of the match (true/false)
