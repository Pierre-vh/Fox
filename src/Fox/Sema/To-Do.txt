Short to-do list & idea dump for Sema

Order of impl:
	Exprs without DeclRefs (only constexprs)
	Decls
	Scopes & Name Resolution
	Stmts

Needed:
	Expr/Stmt/Decl visitors should all be capable of replacing a node if instructed to do so, for optimizations
	& node resolution purposes.

	To do that, I think every "checkXXX" method should return a "SemaResult" which is a wrapper around a ASTNode & a success flag. If the ASTNode
	is nullptr, no replacement happens, but if it is valid, it will replace the node.

	Code would sort of look like
		SemaResult lhs = check(node->getLHS())"
		if(auto rpl = lhs.getReplacement())
			node->setLHS(rpl)

		This is a bit tedious, it would be great to have a simpler version, such as
		doIt(node, node->getLHS(), node.setLHS)
