The Fox Testing Tool (FTT) is going to work by leveraging existing Fox tools such as the parser.

A basic file structure will have comments and Fox language constructs.
Comments that start with /// or /** will be used as FTT instructions.

Example FTT instructions
	1) Parse [Stmt/Decl/Std] -> Sets the parsing mode: expect statements, decls or just a standard file.
	2) Expect: adds immediate predicates that apply to the next parser call
	3) LookFor [Decl::XXX/Expr::XXX/Stmt::XXX] -> Walks the tree until it finds a node of the kind XXX.
Example:

Implementation:
	-> Special testing tool parser to parse directives.
	-> Make the parser ignore comment tokens and work with them enabled without trouble.

	Key parts:
		Custom Parser
		Custom DiagnosticsConsumer

To-Do:
	1) Find a cooler name than "FoxTestingTool"
	2) Update the parser to ignore comment tokens
	2) Test Object, Test Runner
	4) Predicates with the first few predicates/functions
		+ Predicate tests
	5) FTTParser
		+ Parser tests
	6) Bring it all together
