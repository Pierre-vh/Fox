The Fox Testing Tool (FTT) is going to work by leveraging existing Fox tools such as the parser.

A basic file structure will have comments and Fox language constructs.
Comments that start with /// or /** will be used as FTT instructions.

There are only 2 basic FTT instructions for now.
	1) Parse: Tells the tester to parse stmts or decls
		example:
			/// Parse Stmts
		In the future, an extra "count" argument might be created to allow application of the
		same set of predicates to a number of nodes.
	2) Expect: adds immediate predicates that apply to the next node parsed.
			
Implementation:
	TBA:
		Needs support for predicates exclusive to a single parser call.

	A custom DiagnosticConsumer will ignore every diagnostic that shouldn't be emitted.
	The test passes if there are no errors or warnings emitted.

	Key parts:
		Custom Parser
		Custom DiagnosticsConsumer
		Predicates hierarchy

Grammar: TBA
