Work on this part of the project has just started, so expect the BC, BCGen and VM parts
to be incomplete for a bit of time. 

Basic VM data types and their mappings to Fox types:
    Fox       VM
    int       int
    double    double
    bool      int
    char      int
    string    TBA
    []        TBA

---- Implementation of Object types ----
  Note: At first, objects won't be freed. I'll use a leak-forever allocator (LinearAllocator).
    GC will come later when the language is officially "feature-complete", because writing a good, reliable
    GC takes time and I'll probably write a better one with the full design of the language implemented.

  -> Common "Object" base
  -> ArrayObject: Always dynamically sized, essentially just a SmallVector (will maybe even inherit from it). Has a "isReference" flag.
  -> Strings: Similar to ArrayObject. I think they'll also be dynamically sized & mutable, but that's
     subject to change.

  Note: In the future, I'll probably have a UserObject (structs) and a TupleObject (tuples).

---- Getting feature-complete (with the current feature set) ----
  -> LoadStringK instruction (use string constants)
  -> Functions
  -> Codegen of global variables
  -> Intrinsics/FFI
  -> Basic debug information & trivial exception system (for proper error management).
  -> Properly diagnose maximum register pressure exceeded:
    > When the RegisterAllocator runs out of registers, it should call a handler (a BCGen method?)
      that will emit a diagnostic when possible, or at least tell something like (just a suggestion)
      "ran out of registers while compiling function 'foo': function is too complex"
      "note: ran out of registers while compiling this <expr/decl/stmt>" <loc last stmt/expr/decl compiled>
  -> Test/Document as much as possible.

---- Implementing the GC ----
  (Current ideas, highly subject to changes)
  -> "ReferenceMap" (Safe points) to track register that contain references if I decide to do a precise GC.
    -> Implemented in the RegisterAllocator. I'll just need an extra arg to "allocateTemporary" like "RegisterPurpose" to track
       registers holding refs. When a register dies, the corresponding bit is cleared. Import & use llvm::BitVector for that!
  -> Basic GC algorithm: mark and sweep, colored object. Non-generational/non-compacting at first. 
      (I'll try to get decent perf without compacting/generational and then only think about the rest)

---- Other To-Dos ----
  -> Implement a Sethi-Ullman -like algorithm to decide the evaluation order
      of subexpressions (to make regalloc a bit more efficient)

  -> Potentially add a way of skipping 'useless' expressions on a case-by-case
      basis. 
      e.g. don't compile a 'Unary Not -> Unary Not -> Expr', just compile expr.
      I need to see if there's more of them and if it'd be worthwhile to implement such 
      a feature.

  -> Add a RegisterAllocator enableLogging option to emit logs about 
      register allocation, such as "Assignated Register X to Var 'foo' 0xABCDEF"
      or, upon death, emit the total of registers used, something like that.
      Add a "-log-regalloc" option and use write FileCheck tests based on that option.

  -> Properly diagnose out of range jumps in BCGen::StmtGenerator::calculateJumpOffset

  -> When a mut ParamDecl is never written to 
     (= never at the top level of the lhs of an assignement)
     consider it as non mutable, so free it and don't Copy it In/Out
    I can add this directly to the FuncGenPrologue phase so it's used only by
    BCGen, or I can detect this at semantic analysis and add a new flag to ParamDecl
    "isWrittenTo" or something like that
