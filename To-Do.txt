This file contains personal notes I take when writing the project, this is essentially a to-do list.
It isn't definitive, don't take anything listed here for granted. The stuff I write here changes a lot!

  > Identifier & IdentifierTable rework (Done)
   
  > const correctness update: no more double getters for getters of pointers

  > Work on Sema (Now) 
    > Decl semantic analysis (Next)
      > Will need a lot of planification before diving in since it's probably
        the most complicated checker.
    > Name resolution
    > DeclRefExpr 
    > FunctionCallExpr & OVR (overload resolution)
    > UFCS
      > Parser additions (UnresolvedDotExpr)
      > Semantic Analysis

  > Consider a ASTContext interface update:
    -> Add a public SourceManager& and DiagnosticEngine&

  > ASTVerifier (should be able to check both a Checked an Unchecked AST) 
    > once it's done, remove "isValid" in decls

  > Allow cast expr chaining (update grammar & parser)

  > Write Lexer LIT tests

  > IR
  > IRGen
  > VM

Other:
  > Adopt a Documentation style (Doxygen) and document the code with it

  > Spend some time refactoring the Parser. Write betters comment, fix style and
    coding standard issues.

  > Review all includes and try to include as little as possible

  > Investigate how the parser handles recovery to a ';' in a stmt: should the statement handle it
    or should parseStmt handle it?
    > Also, for parseQualType, who should emit the errors? The caller or the callee? No both! Make
      a decision and stick to it.

Pending reworks:
  > Token class -> Currently, it's an abomination. Nuke it and re-do it.
  > Lexer
