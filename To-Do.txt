	> Change how Type::getString displays types. Use 2 functions: getDebugString(), getString(), one is more informative, the second is more user friendly.

	Semantic analysis development is put on hold for now. I'll fix the existing code and do a few more things before
	going back on it. I need to figure out some important stuff. Sorry, lack of preparation on my end.

				e.g. instead of having a ArrayType(SemaType(nullptr)), i'd have a single sematype wtih a "must be array" constraint, but this
					 could be a lot of work. If I manage to make it simple enough, I might do that.
		

	> Basic Expression Semantic analysis (Postponed)
	> Stmt Semantic Analysis
	> Decl Semantic Analysis
	> Name Resolution (DeclRefs of vars)
	> Overload Resolution (Name resolution for memberExprs & DeclRefs of funcs)
		> UFCS
			> UnresolvedDoExpr

Boring stuff that I must do when I have the time/motivation for it
	> Adopt a Documentation style (Doxygen) and document all the code with it

	> ASTWalker code review

	> AST Serialization tool for unit tests

	> Revamp tests:
		Stop tests like I currently do, use a tool like LLVM-lit to do it.
		Keep unit tests the same, strictly separe language tests with unit tests.
			Unit tests are for every language independant stuff:
				Lexer/Tokens
				SourceManager
				DiagnosticEngine
				Driver
				etc..
			Tests are for language semantics with samples bits of code.
Later:
	Use a "SourceFile" class instead of a "UnitDecl" class, like swift. This class would track the progress of the AST:
	not parsed, parsed but not semantically analyzed, etc. Do that when implementing the multifile support

Needed but not yet figured out
	Need a more advanced debugging tool such as a PrettyStackTrace or just a DEBUG_PRINT macro;

Bug:
	If an array is spanned on multiple lines, the "illegal heterogenous" array error will display one extra caret after the [ on the first line.
