An easy to learn, embeddable programming language. 

[WIP]
Fox  
- Lexer : Done  
- Parser & AST : around 80-90% done.
- Semantic Analyser : TypeChecker nearly complete, Scope checker and other have yet to come.
- AST Evaluator : A Debug version is done for expressions, but far from ideal. It's just to evaluate the AST while the backend isn't done.
- - Symbols table manager
- - (etc)
