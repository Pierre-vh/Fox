Grammar 0.10
	I've decided to change the grammar to add a better, more uniform support for complex code. Most of the 
	changes introduced here won't be implemented right away (like member access) but I prefer to make theses changes right now
	since they change how the AST is formed because it changes the priority of ().
+ Added <trailer> rule
	<trailer>	=  <array_access> | <parens_expr_list>
+ Added <array_access> rule // I've decided to add arrays now, since it's a quite vital component imo.
	<array_access>	= '[' <expr> ']'
~ Modified <decl_call>
	<decl_call>		= <id> { <trailer> }
~ Modified <member_access>
	<member_access>	= <primary> { '.' <decl_call> }
