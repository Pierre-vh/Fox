Sema:
  > Basic type:
   A type that can't be unwrapped any further. Currently, only ErrorTypes & PrimitiveTypes are basic.
  > Primitive Type:
    int, float, bool, string, char, void
  > (un)bound type:
    A type that can be "materialized". This includes every type except CellTypes with no substitution.
    e.g.
      int = bound
      [float] = bound
      Cell(Cell(float)) = bound
      Cell(nullptr) = unbound
