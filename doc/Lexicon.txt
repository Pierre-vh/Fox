  > Primitive Type:
    int, float, bool, string, char, void
  > Local Declaration
    A Declaration which is present inside a function declaration (FuncDecl).
    You can use ->isLocal() on any Decl to know if it's a local declaration or not.
    If it's a local declaration, getFuncDecl() will return a pointer to the FuncDecl
    the declaration lives in.
  > Parameter Copy Map (PCM)
    The PCM is generated in the BCGen phase and consumed by the VM when executing the
    function.
    It's a map/vector of bits, and when a bit is set to 1 it means that the
    register at its index should be copied back into the caller's register stack
    when the function returns.
    Naturally, the PCM does not control the copy of arguments into the callee's register stack
    because it's always done.
    e.g.
        PCM: 0-1-0
        -> r0 will not be copied
        -> r1 will be copied
        -> r2 will not be copied
