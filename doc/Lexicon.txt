Sema:
  > Basic type:
    A type that can't be unwrapped any further. Currently, only ErrorTypes & PrimitiveTypes are basic.
  > Primitive Type:
    int, float, bool, string, char, void
  > bound type:
    A type that can be "materialized". This includes every type except CellTypes with no substitution.
    e.g.
      int = bound
      [float] = bound
      Cell(Cell(float)) = bound
      Cell(nullptr) = unbound
  > Local Declaration
    A Declaration which is present inside a function declaration (FuncDecl).
    You can use ->isLocal() on any Decl to know if it's a local declaration or not.
    If it's a local declaration, getFuncDecl() will return a pointer to the FuncDecl
    the declaration lives in.
